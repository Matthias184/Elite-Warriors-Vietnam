BO

// Bio
BO, 20, a Bru tribesman, was SOG's first 'Yard to graduate from HALO (military skydiving) school, as well as the first to complete SOG's basic medic course.   He speaks excellent English.  Bo served six months with Project Delta, the 5th Special Forces Group's Long Range Recon unit, before joining SOG.  He loves his CAR-15 and any kind of suppressed weapon and only grudgingly will carry an M-79.   The least experienced man on your team, Bo displays enthusiasm but needs time to mature.
