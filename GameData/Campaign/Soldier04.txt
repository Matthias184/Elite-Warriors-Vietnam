// Name
WO

// Bio
WO, 19, is a Heleng tribesman, raised in a village near Kontum.  Like all Montagnards, he's a born hunter and tracker, making him a superb recon man.  Wo has prior service with the II Corps Mike Force, where he graduated from parachute school and made one combat jump.  His father was a paratrooper with the French Foreign Legion and fought at Dien Bien Phu.  Wo is possibly the finest M-79 grenadier in Recon, capable of firing up to 12 well-placed rounds per minute.  While he's willing to walk point, he lacks the experience (and confidence) to take that position permanently.
