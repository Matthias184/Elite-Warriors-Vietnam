PRIN

// Bio
PRIN, 22, is a Bru tribesman, raised near the Laotian border just west of Khe Sanh.  A born hunter and tracker, he's naturally a superb recon man.  Blessed with acute hearing and vision, some men claim that when Prin walks point, “it's like you've got a hunting dog up there.”  A graduate of Kontum's Catholic orphanage school, Prin speaks passable English and perfect Vietnamese with a North Vietnamese accent.  In addition to excellent shooting skills, he's one of a handful of Montagnards to graduate from SOG's demolitions school.  Despite his youth, Prin has been in Recon for three years and served on several teams.
