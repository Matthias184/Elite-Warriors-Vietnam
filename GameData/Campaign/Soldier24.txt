// Name
JEN

// Bio
JEN, 33, is the "old man": the oldest 'Yard in Recon.  His Rhade village near Dak Pek was destroyed by the Communists in 1963, inspiring him to volunteer as a CIA "Mountain Scout" who ran one-man, walk-in missions into Laos, 1963-4.  When SOG Recon was founded one year later, Jen was one of the first to join and since then has served on nine different teams, in all positions.  He's a master of every SOG weapon.  His only downside is that he sometimes thinks he knows more than his Special Forces team leader - which occasionally may be true.
