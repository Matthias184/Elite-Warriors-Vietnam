// Bio
ANGAO, 26, is a Rhade tribesman, raised in a remote Central Highlands village.  Like all Montagnards, he's a born hunter and tracker, making him a superb recon man.  He has prior service at the Special Forces camp at Polei Kleng, and served on a SOG Hatchet Force company before being recruited for Recon.  He's an excellent point man, as well as a fine shot with the CAR-15 and AK, although he's not proficient with the M-79 grenade launcher.  He's been wounded twice, once with minor RPG frag wounds, then a serious thigh wound by AK slug.
