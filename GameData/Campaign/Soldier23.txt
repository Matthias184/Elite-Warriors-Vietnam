// Bio
PHIT, 21, is a Rhade tribesman, raised near SOG's launch site at Dak To.   A natural Recon man, he hunted and trapped animals in his youth.  Phit possesses uncanny night vision, the best of anyone in Recon, along with an excellent sense of smell - he can smell a Vietnamese Ruby Queen cigarette at 100 meters!  Phit began his military service at the Dak To Special Forces camp, where he was a CIDG (Civilian Irregular Defense Group) squad leader.  Recruited by SOG two years ago, he's served solely in Recon and thinks he's ready to walk point.
